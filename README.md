# Basic-Text-Adventure
# Final project from university course to help us understand the python language at its core.
# Originally, in my infancy on this platform, I mistakenly placed this project inside of the folder of my two dimension platformer game,
# so I had it moved into its own repository. I might expand on it for my DnD campaigns at some point so it is nice to have around.
